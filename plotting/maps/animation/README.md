# Code for creating animated tracks over a raster map

This folder includes code that plots emperor penguin GPS tracks over a raster map in Antarctica.

This code allows you to:
- Plot tracks over a raster map of sea ice and bathymetry (download seperately)
- Create animated gifs that plot GPS tracks sequentially over time to use in sci. comm. or presentations
- Or export the figures seperately

*Special*:
- This code also helps plot tracks for animals that cross the date line (IMO hard).
